2) In Bitcoin, a "helper" is elected to select which transactions from the pool will go into the block that is about to be mined. Propose two mechanisms to conduct this election process. Hint: use hash functions. 

The mechanism to conduct this election process are via Consensus protocols. The two primary protocols that ase be used to conduct are as follows:

i.Proof of Work (POW)

ii.Proof of Capacity(POC)


Approach:
Let's say we have a voting function y=f(x) and we need to find x. Also, If a miner manages to solve the puzzle(using Hash function), the new block is formed and this is orchestrated by "helper".
Note: I can go deep into hash functions details, but wanted to focus on the algorithm part. 


i.Proof of Work (POW)

a.The "helper" will send the puzzle to miners - thsi basically are the transactions from the pool that will go into the block that is about to be mined
b.Miners send the solution to the "helper"
c."helper" sends it to existing blocks to validate the solutions
d.If validates and approved, then election is done with the Miners being awarded.
e. End result: Election is complete


ii.Proof of Capacity (POC) :
a.The "helper" will send the puzzle to miners and add a nonce.
Note:a.Nonces are created through repeated hashing of data, including your ID of the each member here.
     b.This basically are the transactions from the pool that will go into the block that is about to be mined
b.Miners will need to do plotting on their hard drive. 
c.Here Miners will calculate a scoop number and then use this scoop data to calculate the deadline.
d.If Miner can forge a block within the deadline, Miners will be given the right to vote
e.If validated and approved, then election is done with the Miners being awarded.
End result: Election is complete
